# Cucumis Sextus ToDo List

* rename repo so that it no longer starts with perl6-
* reporting when no features are found should be neater (so should prove6)
* should also look in 'f' to match prove6, in reverse prove6 should look in
  'tests' too
* what does prove6 do around the 'lib'? does it auto-add it? if so then we
  should too. if not, does that mean prove6 could test the installed rather than
  the code from this repo if that line is missing?
* we should have a comprehensive, standalone example in a subdir
* file extensions, README etc for raku rename
